# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is used whenever we want to predict a certain
outcome from a given input, and we have examples of input/output pairs. We build a
machine learning model from these input/output pairs, which comprise our training
set. Our goal is to make accurate predictions for new, never-before-seen data. Supervised
learning often requires human effort to build the training set, but afterward
automates and often speeds up an otherwise laborious or infeasible task.

## Classification and Regression
There are two major types of supervised machine learning problems, called classification
and regression.

In classification, the goal is to predict a class label, which is a choice from a predefined
list of possibilities. You can think of binary classification as trying to answer a yes/no question. 
Classifying emails as either spam or not spam is an example of a binary classification problem.
